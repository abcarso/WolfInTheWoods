Wolf in the Woods is a 3D atmospheric exploration game created in Unity using C#.
It was developed as a solo project in Spring 2025 as part of my 3D Game Programming coursework at Clemson University.

In this project, I designed and implemented key systems including:

A custom player controller with sprint and hunger mechanics

A dialog system built using Unity ScriptableObjects

Integration of audio and art assets to support the gameâ€™s dark amospheric play

Through this project, I deepened my experience with Unity development, C# scripting, and version control in GitHub.
I also explored how game systems and environment design can contribute to mood and player experience.

*All assets utilized were obtained through Unity Store's Free assets under EULA licensing.*
